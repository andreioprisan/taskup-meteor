    You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. Personal identifiable information such as your email address, phone number, postal address, and payment information may be collected if you choose to sign up for an account on the site. This information will be strictly used to identify you on the system and will not be sold to third parties or shared without your consent.<br>
    <br>
    We may use your personally identifiable information to register you to use our Site and Services, deliver certain services, provide notices regarding services or services you have purchased or licensed, and verify your authority to enter our Site, and to contact you, including by email or telephone. We may use your email address and telephone number to contact you, without further consent, for administrative communications, to address copyright infringement or defamation or other violations of Terms of Service issues, or to contact you regarding your membership, subscription, or any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Site.<br>
    <br>
    Cookies<br>
    When you use or access the taskup Site we may use small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters called cookies to improve overall Site experience, among other things. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you. taskup may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie generally disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the taskup site or other web sites. Persistent cookies can generally be removed by you. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings and to remove cookies. We may also use web beacons on our site and in emails that we send to you. We may collect information regarding pages visited, searches performed, and actions made.<br>
    <br>
    Automatically Collected Information<br>
    When you access the Site or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology, including server logs. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique device or user ID, version of software installed, system type, browser used, the content and pages that you access on the Site, the dates and times that you visit the Site, actions that you made and items that you clicked on.<br>
    <br>
    Like most Web sites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These "server logs" typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.<br>
    <br>
    Aggregate Information<br>
    The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, browser type, and IP addresses, and we may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.<br>
    <br>
    Disclosure<br>
    We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or in cooperation with any governmental investigation, including upon receipt of what we believe may be a valid subpoena, whether issued by a Court that has jurisdiction over taskup or not. (Please note that taskup reserves the right to assert that only the court in the U.S. have jurisdiction, and subpoenas from outside those jurisdictions must be "domesticated," though we are not obligated to do so.)<br>
    <br>
    We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization; however, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which taskup participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of taskup's assets to which this Site relates.<br>
    <br>
    Profile Information<br>

    <br>

Rather, we use a third party credit card processor, Stripe (http://www.stripe.com). Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor, and is certified to <a href="http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/cisp-list-of-pcidss-compliant-service-providers.pdf">PCI Service Provider Level 1</a>. This is the most stringent level of certification available. Your credit card details are converted to a single-use encrypted token which is then safely passed to Stripe for payment authorization.<br>

    17.1. In the United States, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the DMCA) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Other protections for copyright owners are available in other jurisdictions. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Website infringe Your copyright, You (or Your agent) may send TaskUp a notice requesting TaskUp to remove the material or disable access to it. If You believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against You, please send TaskUp a counter-notice. In the United States, notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see http://www.copyright.gov for details). In addition, notices should include: Your contact details, the full bibliographic details of the material, the exact and full URL where You found the material, proof that You are the rights holder and a statement that, under penalty of perjury, You are the rights holder or are an authorized representative. <br>
    17.2. Upon receipt of notification the Notice and Takedown procedure is then invoked as follows: (a) TaskUp will acknowledge receipt of Your complaint and will make an initial assessment of the validity and plausibility of the complaint; (b) upon receipt of a valid complaint the material will be temporarily removed from the website pending an agreed solution; (c) e will contact the contributor who deposited the material, if relevant, and the contributor will be notified that the material is subject to a complaint, under what allegations, and will be encouraged to assuage the complaints concerned; (d) the complainant and the contributor will be encouraged to resolve the issue swiftly and amicably and to the satisfaction of both parties, and the material is replaced on the website unchanged or with changes, or is permanently removed. If the contributor and the complainant are unable to agree a solution, the material will remain unavailable through the Website until a time when a resolution has been reached. <br>

    18.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Privacy Policy and any other Additional Terms of Services or of the Website posted by TaskUp, including all exhibits and addenda hereto and all Order Forms, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. <br>
    18.3.

If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and TaskUp' failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AND TaskUp AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE WEBSITE AND/OR THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED. <br>
